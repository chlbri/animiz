The only defense against these creatures is the secret agency known as the Gutsy Geoid Guard (or 3G) and their ultimate weapon, the awesome giant robot GaoGaiGar. GaoGaiGar's pilot, Guy Shishio, is a former astronaut who was nearly killed two years before when the Zonders first crashed to earth. Guy's life was spared when a mysterious robot lion called Galeon pulled him from the burning shuttle and brought him to Earth. Guy's father, Leo, then used Galeon's technology to rebuild his shattered son as a cyborg, in the hopes that he could stop the aliens when they appear. Now, with Galeon as its core, GaoGaiGar fights to protect Earth. He is aided by a team of transforming robots and by a young boy named Mamoru, who has the power to purify the Zonders' cores, and seems to be connected to the mysterious Galeon.\n<br><br>\n(Source: Anime News Network)",

Oh sure, the new health care is great, but the public ban on the use of swords has left a lot of defeated samurai with a difficult decision to make concerning their future career paths! This is especially true if, as in the case of Gintoki Sakata, they're not particularly inclined towards holding a day job, which is why Gintoki's opted for the freelance route, taking any job that's offered to him as long as the financial remuneration sounds right. Unfortunately, in a brave new world filled with stray bug-eyed monsters, upwardly mobile Yakuza and overly ambitious E.T. entrepreneurs, those jobs usually don't pay as well as they should for the pain, suffering and indignities endured!<br><br>\n(Source: Sentai Filmworks)",

    "description": "Maison Ikkoku is a romantic comedy series created by Rumiko Takahashi. The story centers around the development of the relationship between Kyoko Otonashi and Yusaku Godai. Kyoko is a recent widow who moves into the apartment house Ikkoku-kan where she becomes the manager. Godai is a wanna-be student (\"ronin\") struggling with college entrance exams.<br><br>\nWhen they meet, it's love at first sight&mdash;for Godai anyway. Along the way, the other tentants, the mysterious Yotsuya, the seemingly alcoholic Ichinose, and the brash Akemi, watch and occasionally take part to make their lives more interesting. To complicate matters further, the wealthy tennis coach Shun Mitaka has his eye on Kyoko, while Godai is pursued by both Nanao Kozue and Ibuki Yagami. Covering a wide range of emotions from hysterically funny to painfully sad, Maison Ikkoku&mdash;all 96 episodes&mdash;is well worth seeing.<br>",

Jin is very cute, and all the girls in Touko&rsquo;s class like him a lot. Touko, however, still thinks he is odd, and she can feel him looking at her sometimes, though she has a hard time catching him at it. But she doesn&rsquo;t have much time to dwell on the new student.<br><br>\nTouko is busy trying to deal with some awful school bullying. After accusing her of stealing someone&rsquo;s boyfriend (something she didn&rsquo;t do) all the girls in her class have been playing mean tricks on Touko. It&rsquo;s the usual Japanese school bullying &mdash; Scrawling unpleasant remarks in her class notebooks, putting needles and thumbtacks in her indoor school shoes, ignoring her, that sort of thing. Touko quietly puts up with it all, and really only manages to cope thanks to the loyal friendship of her friend Miyuki. Miyuki is the only one who ignores all the bullying and remains friends with Touko.<br><br>\nEnduring the cruelty is a pain, and Touko can sometimes sense that Jin is observing her and knows what is going on. He too, doesn&rsquo;t seem to mind being friendly to Touko in spite of her outcast status. Jin is very mysterious, and has a sort of unusual aura around him, like Touko can sense something different. However, because Jin is cute and pupular, his attention and friendliness towards Touko only causes her more problems. Jealous of her, the other girls increase their bullying, and it gets to a point where they threaten Touko&rsquo;s life by hanging her out a window!<br><br>\nBut then something really odd happens. Jin steps in, claiming that Touko is about to die there. How exactly does he know this? The other girls were just being mean, and had no intention to actually kill Touko. But Jin knows what will happen. Why? He claims that he is actually from the 23rd century, and he is there to save her! How can anyone possibly believe that?! Then again, he did ask such a strange question when they first met. Is Jin really from the future? Would Touko really have died there, and why would he want to save her?
